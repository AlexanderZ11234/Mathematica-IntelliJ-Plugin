/**
 * Provides features which generally help to ease coding and prevent errors while typing in the editor.
 * The last sentence is not entirely true, since there exist other things which help you with writing code, but I'll
 * use the term <em >code-insight</em> when I mean things like
 * <ul >
 *     <li >Syntax-, error-highlighting through different colors and styles in the editor.</li>
 *     <li >Simple input helper like insertion of paired braces and quotes.</li>
 *     <li >Intelligent and static code completion while you are typing.</li>
 *     <li >In addition to highlighting, the annotation of more complex stuff like the expression
 *     <code >(#1^2+#2^2)&</code> to see instantly the anonymous function. This help to overlook even complex code-
 *     structures more easily and prevents errors.</li>
 *     <li >So-called <em >LiveTemplates</em> which let's you expand very short words quite complex code templates.
 *     One prominent example is that IDEA expands <code >psvm</code> into a complete main function.</li>
 *     <li >Commenting and de-commenting code blocks, lines or selected regions.</li>
 * </ul>
