<ul>
    <li>ReleaseJavaObject[javaobject] tells the Java memory-management system to forget about any references to the
        specified JavaObject that are being maintained solely for the sake of Mathematica. The JavaObject in Mathematica
        is no longer valid after the call. You call ReleaseJavaObject when you are completely finished with an object in
        Mathematica, and you want to allow it to be garbage-collected in Java.
