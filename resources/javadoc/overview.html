    <TITLE>A Mathematica Plugin for IntelliJ IDEA</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
This document is not an API documentation, because there is no API; instead it is a collection of implementation notes.

I tried to put as much useful information in the java comments as possible to explain how algorithms are working
and how the IDEA openAPI was used implement the various features. Therefore, these pages are for people who want to
extend the code with additional functionality or for people creating their own custom language plugin. Those people
might find some useful tips regarding the use of the openAPI, the implementation of a Mathematica parser, how
highlighting and code annotation work or other things.<br>

<h2>Where to start</h2>
In a first step in order to compile the plugin you need to setup IDEA for plugin development. For this purpose I wrote
an article explaining this step by step which can be found in the
<a href="https://github.com/halirutan/Mathematica-IntelliJ-Plugin/wiki/Join-the-development">Wiki of the plugins GitHub
    repository.</a><br>

Otherwise, I suggest start at plugin.xml in the resources directory and just skim through it.
You'll see, that every feature is registered in this file and from there you can navigate with Ctrl+Click on the
implementing classes. You'll see that many features are easy and require almost no logic while others (like
lang.parserDefinition) require a lot of code if you follow all implementations.
