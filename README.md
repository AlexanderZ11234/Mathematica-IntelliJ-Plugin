Mathematica language plugin for IntelliJ IDEA
=============================================


- The official website for plugin users is [hosted here](http://mathematicaplugin.halirutan.de/) and there, you can find detailed installation instructions.
- The most recent development version of the plugin is [Mathematica-IntelliJ-Plugin.zip](https://github.com/halirutan/Mathematica-IntelliJ-Plugin/raw/develop/Mathematica-IntelliJ-Plugin.zip)
  in the root of this repository.
- If you find bugs or experience weird behavior please [create a new issue](http://halirutan.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues#newissue=yes)
  on the [*Mathematica* bugtracker page](http://halirutan.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/issues/MMAP).
- If you want to participate (there is a lot more to do then just code Java!) please read [this section](http://mathematicaplugin.halirutan.de/index.php/development)
  first, where I have published documentation, which helps to get a smooth start. When you think you need to discuss stuff directly with
  me, you can always reach me in the main chat at mathematica.stackexchange.com or in the
  [IntelliJIDEA Mathematica plugin room](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/8636/intellijidea-plugin-for-mathematica) which
  was created for that purpose.
- The extracted java documentation can be found under [halirutan.github.io/Mathematica-IntelliJ-Plugin](http://halirutan.github.io/Mathematica-IntelliJ-Plugin/).
- Finally, you may want to read the [official post](http://mathematica.stackexchange.com/q/24556/187) on mathematica.stackexchange.com
  where I announced the plugin.
